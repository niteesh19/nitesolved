/**
 * Created by gouthamvidyapradhan on 12/12/2017. Given an array of citations (each citation is a
 * non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
 *
 * <p>According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her
 * N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations
 * each."
 *
 * <p>For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in
 * total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher
 * has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations
 * each, his h-index is 3.
 *
 * <p>Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 *
 * One solution is first sorting the array and then doing H-index-2 solution -> O(nlogn) + O(n)
 * <p>Solution O(n) Replace all the citations which are greater than n with n, the result will not
 * change with this operation. Maintain a count array with count of each citations. Sum up all the
 * counts from n -> 0 and store this in a array S. Value in array index Si is number of papers
 * having citations at least i.
 *
 * <p>The first value at index i, from right to left in array S which has i <= Si is the answer.

      else

    }
    // bucket: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]
    // and now we cumulate sum from back of array and if that matches i, we have the ans
